# Web-Design-Challenge

We have created a visualization dashboard website using html, css, media queries and bootstrap. This project has been deployed to Github Pages. This site contains 7 induvidual pages. Index.html is the landing page which also contains an explaination of the project. Each page has:

    1. a navigation menu which alows a user to return to the landing page
    2. a dropdown menu called "Plots" providing a link to each individual visualisation page.
    3. "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, 
    4. "Data," which links to the data page.

I have utised Bootstrap for the navbar header on every page, and a Bootstrap grid for responsiveness to the data page. I have used CSS media query for responsiveness in the navigation menu.

I have checked that the website works at all widths/sizes.
